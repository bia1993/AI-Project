# AI-Project
An AI project done in university focusing on the A* method.

This was a group project done in university in 2015 for the Artificial Intelligence class. The idea was to create a map with obstacles and different terrains of different costs and use the A* method to find the best path until the end of the map.

The theme of the project was Saint Seiya. The objective is for the five Bronze Saints to reach Athena while 'fighting' past the Gold Saints. Each Bronze Saint's cosmo influences the outcome of the battle, since different Gold Saints have different power levels too.

Each Bronze Saint only has 5 lives, so not only did we have to find the best route, but we also had to find the best team to fight each Gold Saint, in order to have at least one Bronze Saint alive until the end.

This is one of the projects I am by far the proudest of :)
